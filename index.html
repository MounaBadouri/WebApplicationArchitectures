     <li>This project was made by my friend and I <br>last year for the module of BDD(Base de Données<br> et interopérabilité), it was a very fun and interesting project<br> since we had to apply the knowledge acquired from the <br> course and we had a certain margin of creativity<br> design-wise, the language we used is C#<br> and we also dealed with MySQL<br> to handle the data correctly, as for the interface we used<br> WPF which is a .NET based UI. </li>

     <li>This project was done last year in the python module,<br> where we were asked to run an app that will help with the<br> management of ressources in the lockdown,<br> as you might notice this was done in the early era of covid. So the goal here was to help <br>households order necessities or packges already filled with basic needs <br> based on the type for example a vegetable package will contain specific veggies<br>but if the user isn't satisfied with the ingredient<br> they can personalize it according to their preference. <br>We used python for this project and applied the<br> geopanda package and also the django module to visualize it</li>

     <li>Out of all the projects this was my favorite, why ? You might ask. Well, it was a project that we were assigned to during the elective week this year,<br> in the module of data visualization and art, we were asked to make a visualization based on actual data but we should make it the most creative and artsy as possible. We have chosen to visualize Trump's tweets<br> and to represent the words he most frequently uses that are a bit subjective and explicit all while presenting them in his trum tower. This project had instantly the approval of the teacher since it was creative and quite humorous. </li>

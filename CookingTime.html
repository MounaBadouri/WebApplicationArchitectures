  <li>This project was made by my friend and I last year for the module of BDD(Base de Données et interopérabilité), it was a very fun and interesting project since we had to apply the knowledge acquired from the course and we had a certain margin of creativity design-wise, the language we used is C# and we also dealed with MySQL to handle the data correctly, as for the interface we used WPF which is a .NET based UI. </li>
